Welcome to the Hotel Booking Data Analysis project! In this project, we explore and analyze a dataset containing hotel booking information to derive insights and patterns that can be useful for understanding booking trends, customer behavior, and other factors affecting the hospitality industry.
## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset obtained from hotel booking records, including information such as booking dates, hotel details, guest demographics, and reservation statuses. By leveraging SQL queries and data analysis techniques, we aim to answer various questions and uncover valuable insights from the dataset.
## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project consists of [insert number] rows of data, representing hotel bookings. Before analysis, the dataset underwent a data cleaning process to handle missing values (NULLs) and ensure data quality.
## Analysis Questions
To guide our analysis, we formulated several key questions to explore and address using the dataset:
- What is the overall cancellation rate for hotel bookings?
- Which countries are the top contributors to hotel bookings?
- What are the main market segments booking the hotels, such as leisure or corporate?
- Is there a relationship between deposit type (e.g., non-refundable, refundable) and the likelihood of cancellation?
- How long do guests typically stay in hotels on average?
- What meal options (e.g., breakfast included, half-board) are most preferred by guests?
- Do bookings made through agents exhibit different cancellation rates or booking durations compared to direct bookings?
- How do prices vary across different hotels and room types? Are there any seasonal pricing trends?
- What percentage of bookings require car parking spaces, and does this vary by hotel location or other factors?
- What are the main reservation statuses (e.g., confirmed, canceled, checked-in), and how do they change over time?
- What is the distribution of guests based on the number of adults, children, and stays in weekend nights?

 - Which email domains are most commonly used for making hotel bookings?
- Are there any frequently occurring names in hotel bookings, and do they exhibit any specific booking patterns?
- Which market segments contribute the most revenue to the hotels?
- How do booking patterns vary across different seasons or months of the year?
## Getting Started
To replicate the analysis or explore the dataset further, follow these steps:

3. Load the provided dataset into your SQL database.
4. Execute the SQL queries provided in the repository to analyze the data and derive insights. 5. Customize the analysis or queries as needed for your specific objectives.
## Conclusion
Through this project, we aim to provide valuable insights into hotel booking trends, customer preferences, and other factors influencing the hospitality industry. By analyzing the dataset and addressing the key questions, we hope to assist stakeholders in making informed decisions and optimizing their operations.
